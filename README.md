# AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System

This project uses Machine Learning and Security Logs to detect cyber threats in real time. It classifies intrusions such as DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R, and Normal traffic using AI.

---

## Features
- AI-powered intrusion detection
- Detects malware, phishing, DoS, Probe, and unauthorized access attacks
- Uses Scikit-learn and Flask for training and API deployment
- Real-time threat predictions with confidence scores

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/mahasweta99/cybersecurity-threat-ai.git
cd cybersecurity-threat-ai
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step-by-Step Usage

### A. Preprocess the Data
Converts ARFF to CSV, applies label encoding.
```cmd
python src\preprocess.py
```

### B. Train the Model
Trains a Random Forest classifier on the preprocessed data.
```cmd
python src\train.py
```

### C. Test the Model Locally (Optional)
```cmd
python src\predict.py
```

### D. Deploy the API
Runs the Flask server for real-time predictions.
```cmd
python src\deploy.py
```

### E. Send a Test Request
Use curl or Postman to test the model API.
```cmd
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict ^
-H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
-d "{\"duration\": 0, \"protocol_type\": 0, \"service\": 11, ... }"
```

## API Response Example
```json
{
  "prediction": ["normal"],
  "confidence": [1.0]
}
```
